## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

### Continued Development

In the future, I plan to improve this project with the following features:

- Add a Google Maps feature for every country
- Make the cards smoother using Motion.dev animations
- Add a "Back to Top" button for mobile devices so users can return to the top without scrolling

### Useful resources

- [shadcn/ui Documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) – This resource explains how shadcn components are structured and composed. It helped me understand how to customize and extend components instead of treating them as a fixed library.
